# Airline Edition — Risk & Revenue Simulation Engine (Audit-Grade)

## What it does
This engine simulates airline ticket and flight operational scenarios (normal + disruption), then produces:
- Executive PDF report (risk, revenue, loss probability, KPIs)
- Traceable event logs (audit-grade replay)
- Dashboard-ready CSVs and plots

## Who pays for this
- Airlines (Revenue Management, Risk, Ops, Compliance)
- Aviation consultancies
- Insurers / auditors (risk quantification)

## Why it is valuable
It answers business questions like:
- “What is the probability of loss under disruption?”
- “What is our VaR / CVaR under stress scenarios?”
- “What decision policy reduces denied boarding losses?”

## Demo (one command)
```bash
./scripts/demo.sh

Title
Decision Explainability Layer for Airline Operations
The Problem
Operational decisions made under extreme time pressure

Legal/regulatory exposure without structured rationale

Post-incident analysis disconnected from real decisions
The Insight
Airlines do not need “AI pilots”.
They need decision accountability that works with humans, not instead of them.
What This System Does
Simulates operational decisions before execution

Quantifies risk, loss, and regulatory exposure

Records human overrides with justification

Produces regulator-ready audit trails

Learns from incidents post-operation
What It Does NOT Do
Does not replace OCC systems

Does not automate final decisions

Does not change SOPs

Does not touch safety-critical controls
How Airlines Use It
Shadow mode during live operations, followed by post-incident learning and executive reporting.
Why It Matters Now
Increasing operational disruption, regulatory scrutiny, and public accountability require explainable decision intelligence — not more dashboards.
